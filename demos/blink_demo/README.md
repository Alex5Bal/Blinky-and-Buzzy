## Description
This interrupt-driven program flashes the LEDs in a silly pattern.

## Exploration
_Changing speed:_ Figure out how to flash the lights faster or slower.  Determine if there's a speed where the lights don't appear to flash... but glow instead!

_Counting to three:_  Change the program to slowly and repeatedly
count from zero to three, displaying the value in binary using the red
& green lights. This is simpler than the program we provided.

## Some Advice
When creating your own variants to the demo programs,
it's probably a good idea to keep a copy of the original program (or really understand how _git checkout_ works).
