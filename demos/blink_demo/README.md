msp430 blink demo

# Description

This interrupt-driven program flashes the leds in a silly pattern.

# Modifications you probably want to try:

_Changing speed:_ Figure out how to flash the lights faster or slower.  Determine if there's a speed where the lights don't appear to flash... but glow insted!

_Counting to three:_  Change the program to slowly and repeatedly
count from zero to three, displaying the value in binary using the red
& green lights. This is simpler than the program we provided.

A general suggestion: When creating your own variants to our programs,
it's probably better to copy our program to another directory.
