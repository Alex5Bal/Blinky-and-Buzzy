msp430-light-and-sound game with demos

## Project Description

The ACME company has a bunch of these cool boards that they will put in cases to distribute for kids to play with and to donate to local orphanges. You have been hired to make a cool game that uses its buttons and lights, and produces sound. It must have all of these features. In order to help you facilitate your development of this, ACME has found some experimental code from the previous developers that seem to illustrate the use of basic I/O and interrupts. We have initialized this repository for you. The "demos" directory contains the experimental code that you may use to aid in the development of your game and the "project" directory is where you will write the source code for your game.
